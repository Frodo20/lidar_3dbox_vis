Visualization of the point clouds and 3dbox predicted on the KITTI 00 sequence

The complete project can generate the IMU, GPS, car model, and the 2d box in the image, but are not finished in this project.

The .py in lidar can also generate the same results, but the heading of the 3d box is wrong, and is still not fixed.
